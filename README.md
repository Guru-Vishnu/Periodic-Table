# Periodic-Table
C++ Program based on Object Oriented Programming and File Handling Concepts to Collect and Store Details of Chemical Elements and Display them in the Modern Periodic Table Format

This program was written during my grade 12 for the All India Senior Secondary Practical Examination for Computer Science. 

## Introduction

The Periodic Table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties, whose structure shows periodic trends. It is one of the most important tools in the field of science and research. Many new elements are being discovered or invented by scientists and engineers all over the world. Further, many existing scientific data about the elements are modified based on the results of new experiments carried out using modern technology.

Periodic Table of The Elements is a project in C++ which makes use of Object Oriented Programming. It can perform a range of tasks in managing scientific data about the elements in the periodic table based on file handling. Scientific data of the elements are stored in a binary file “Periodic_Table.dat” which contains objects of class Element.
